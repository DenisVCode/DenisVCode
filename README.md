## Hello!

I am a Voice Developer with main focus on Google Assistant. As a Google Developer Expert, I shared my knowledge across 30+ meetups and conferences, reaching thousands of developers. I develop tools and write articles to help out others and make Voice Development easier. 

Most of the projects were created using TypeScript, Node.js, and Firebase, but I am open to new learning opportunities, I use GitHub for VS and Google Apps Script when in need to make G Suite even better or superpower some Spreadsheets.
